## Description of Project

This is the first assignment of CIS 365. This assignment contains 4 Java programs:

### Problem 1: FizzBuzz

* Prints numbers 1 to 100
* Except for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

### Problem 2: Primes

* Prints the 1000th prime number

### Problem 3: ReverseString()

* Write a function called ReverseString() that takes one argument You may assume that the
  argument is a string.
* Return the a string with all of the characters in reverse order.
* For example: the string "reverse" will return "esrever".
  * What happens if null is passed in as an argument? How can we prevent problems caused by null
  or undefined?

### Problem 4: IsUnique()

* Write a function called IsUnique() that takes an array as an argument You may assume that the
array has only strings.
  * Return true is every element in the array is unique.
  * Return false is two or more elements are the same.
* How can you make this work for an array of something other than strings? What needs to
change?
